		<h1>Benefits of vehicle insurance </h1>
		<h3>Vehicle insurance has many benefits for drivers. Here are some of the main ones:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>It's the law: In many countries, you need vehicle insurance by law. Not having it can result in fines or other legal 				consequences.</li>
			<li>It protects you financially: If your car is damaged or stolen, the insurance company will pay for the repairs or a replacement. 	This can save you a lot of money.</li>
			<li>It covers you if you cause damage: If you cause an accident, your insurance will pay for the damages or injuries you cause to 		other people or their property. This can prevent you from having to pay a lot of money out of your own pocket.</li>
			<li>It gives you peace of mind: Knowing you have insurance can make you feel less worried while driving. You'll know you're covered 	if something goes wrong.</li>
			<li>It can provide roadside assistance: Some insurance policies include help if your car breaks down or you have an emergency while 	driving.</li>
			<li>You can choose extra coverage: Depending on your policy, you can add coverage for things like weather damage or theft.</li>
		</ul>
		<p> Overall, vehicle insurance is important for protecting yourself and others while driving. </p>
