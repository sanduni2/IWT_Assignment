		<h1>Why do we put vehicle insurance? </h1>
		<h3>Car insurance is a deal between you and an insurance company. It helps you if something bad happens while you're driving. Here 		are some reasons why it's important:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>It saves you money: If you don't have car insurance and you get into an accident, you will have to pay for everything 			yourself. That can be really expensive. But if you have car insurance, the insurance company pays for the damages or 			injuries.</li>
			<li>It covers you if you hurt someone else: You need to have car insurance by law in most places. This is because it helps pay 		for any damages or injuries you cause to other people or their cars while driving.</li>
			<li>It protects your own car: Car insurance can also pay for damages to your car. This could be from an accident, theft, or 		other bad things that might happen.</li>
			<li>It helps you feel less worried: When you know you have car insurance, you can relax a bit more while driving. You don't 		have to worry so much about what might happen if something goes wrong.</li>
